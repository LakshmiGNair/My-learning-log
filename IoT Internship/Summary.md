## 🌐 What I Learned

This was my first internship, and it introduced me to the world of IoT and Python programming.

### Topics Covered:
- What IoT is and where it's used in real life
- How software (like Python) can control hardware
- Basics of Python programming using IDLE
- Hands-on coding: making LEDs blink, fade, and control traffic lights
- A mini project simulating traffic lights using code

## 🌱 Personal Reflection

Before this internship, I had no idea about IoT or Python — I had only heard those words. Now, I have a starting point. I learned how simple code can control hardware and 
make real-world applications. It was exciting to see LEDs blink and build a traffic light simulation using Python.

This internship gave me a spark. I realized that I’m interested in the IoT field and I plan to learn more about it. It also made me curious to continue learning Python on 
my own.
