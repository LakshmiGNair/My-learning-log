# ðŸŒ± My Learning Log

Hi! I'm Lakshmi, a B.Tech Electronics & Communication student exploring the world of tech, open source, and personal growth.

This is a small space where I keep track of the things I'm learning â€” from workshops, projects, or just curious experimenting.

### What you might find here:
- Notes from tech workshops & sessions
- Bits of code Iâ€™m trying to understand
- My experience with GitHub, tools, and tech
- Reflections from hackathons or internships

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ’»âœ¨
